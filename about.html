    <div id="about">
      I designed this page for people like myself who LOVE travelling but HATE
      packing, and that nagging feeling you might have forgotten something
      essential on the journey to the airport.
    </div>
    <div id="how-it-works">
      This page grants you the ability to pre plan your bag and check off items
      as you pack them, preventing that dredded feeling and allowing you to
      travel with the assurance that you have everything you need.
