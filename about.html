        I designed this page for people like myself who LOVE traveling but HATE
        packing, and that nagging feeling you might have forgotten something
        essential on the journey to the airport.
      </p>
      <p class="about-section">
        This page grants you the ability to pre-plan your bag and check off
        items as you pack them, preventing that dreaded feeling and allowing you
        to travel with the assurance that you have everything you need.
      </p>
      <p class="about-section">
        Simply follow the instructions at the top of each page to create a
        custom packing list for your next trip!
